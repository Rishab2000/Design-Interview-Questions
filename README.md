# Design interview questions from different companies
This repository aims to create a helpful resource for designers to prepare for their interview. 

We all know the anxiety and stress that comes with preparing for interviews. By collating and organising various questions talented, beautiful and amazing designers were asked during interviews; we can create community where we can help out each-other my making that process a wee bit easier. 

The goal for now is to focus on the question, company and role. However, we will always look at making this resource richer and update this page to showcase new additions.

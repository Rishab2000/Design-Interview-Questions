# Design interview questions from different companies
This repository aims to create a helpful resource for designers to prepare for their interviews. 

We all know the anxiety and stress that comes with preparing for interviews. By collating and organising questions asked to our brave soldiers (designers)  during interviews; we can create a community where we can lend a hand to each other by making that process a wee bit easier. 

The goal, for now, is to focus on the question, company and role. However, we are always eying opportunities to make this resource richer, updating this page to showcase new additions.

Please be as detailed as possible with the information you want to contribute. Although any contributions are appreciated!
